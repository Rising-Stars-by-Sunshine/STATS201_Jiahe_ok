#Here is my data
The data query involves obtaining a cross-sectional dataset from two sources: Cancer Data World and Kaggle. This dataset contains information on individuals' obesity levels and lung cancer outcomes. The variables of interest include the dependent variable, representing the incidence or severity of lung cancer categorized as low, medium, or high, and the independent variable, which denotes levels of obesity on a scale of 1 to 9 as provided in the dataset. The query aims to gather comprehensive data for analysis, capturing the nuanced relationship between obesity and lung cancer. The dataset's cross-sectional nature allows for a snapshot of individuals' characteristics and outcomes at a specific point in time, facilitating the investigation into patterns or correlations between obesity levels and lung cancer incidence. This data query sets the foundation for the subsequent machine learning analysis, which seeks to explore and understand the complex interplay between obesity and lung cancer risk.
