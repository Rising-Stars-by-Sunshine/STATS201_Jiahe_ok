Fig. 1. Sample result of Eastern Mediterranean
In this Python code, a Dash web application is created to visualize COVID-19 data using Plotly Express. The dataset is loaded from a GitHub repository, and the app includes a dropdown menu to select a specific WHO region. The scatter plot dynamically updates based on the chosen region, displaying the relationship between latitude ('Lat') and the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases ('Confirmed') for each country/region. The scatter plot color-codes data points by country/region, providing a visual representation of the distribution of confirmed cases across different locations within the selected WHO region. The app offers an interactive platform for exploring and analyzing COVID-19 data with a focus on geographical patterns.
Fig 1 is an example of how the result is like. This figure only visualize the result in Eastern Mediterranean, but the user can tab to choose to see the result in any other regions.
